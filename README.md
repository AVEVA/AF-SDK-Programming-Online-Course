# AF-SDK-Programming-Online-Course
C# and VB.NET source code for the online course [Developing Applications with AF SDK](https://pisquare.osisoft.com/community/Learn-PI/developing-applications-with-PI-AF-SDK).

## Getting Started
This facilitator-led online course offered by OSIsoft's Learning Department is different than the [AF SDK Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/osisoft/AF-SDK-Getting-Started-Guide).  However, both are good resources for beginners.

Complete walkthrough of the code can be found in the videos avaiable at the [course website](https://pisquare.osisoft.com/community/Learn-PI/developing-applications-with-PI-AF-SDK). If you are taking the course, please feel free to download or fork the repository so you can work off your own copy. Feel free to take ownership of your copy and modify the code as you see fit.

Although this course is intended for beginners to AF SDK, a prerequisite is prior development experience with .NET and Visual Studio.
