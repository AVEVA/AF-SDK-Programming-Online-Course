Exercise 3 - Adding Notifications Viewer on top of Exercise 2

This exercise picks up where Exercise 2 left off.  However, to expose learners to a variety of different techniques, the data values ListBox in Exercise 2 has been replaced here with a DataGridView.

This exercise requires several changes in your AFDatabase to account for event frames (notification instances) automatically triggered by Asset Analytics.  See the file named **Weather Exercise 3.xml** to import as a new AFDatabase.
