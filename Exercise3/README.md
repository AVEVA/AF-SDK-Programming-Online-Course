# Exercise 3 - Adding Notifications Viewer on top of Exercise 2

This exercise picks up where Exercise 2 left off.  However, to expose learners to a variety of different techniques, the data values ListBox in Exercise 2 has been replaced here with a DataGridView.

Obviously, your database will need a Notification Rule Template in order to see notification instances (event frames).  But a Notification Rule Template will need an Asset Analysis Template for generating event frames.  And to generate event frames, you will need an event frame template.

Examples of needed objects may be found in the file named **Weather Exercise 3.xml**.  Import as a new AFDatabase.  You may then backfill some analyses since yesterday.  Once that is done, the event frames should be visible in the new form.
